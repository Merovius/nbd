# Go implementation of the Linux Network Block Device protocol

This repository contains Go implementations of

* [The NBD network protocol][nbd-proto] (both client and server).
* The [Netlink API for NBD][nbd-netlink-h], to configure the in-kernel NBD
  client.
* [A basic CLI tool][nbd-tool] that uses these implementations.

It's currently in beta and thus there are a bunch of known (and unknown)
issues. Check the ["beta" label][beta-issues] for known problems. It is
particularly interesting if you require features that are not yet supported.
Please comment/vote on the corresponding issue.

# Installation

Currently, this is pre-release, so the onlý way to install is from source. To
do that, use

```
go get -u github.com/Merovius/nbd
```

# Using the library

There are two packages:
* [nbd][godoc-nbd], containing the client and server implementations of the
  network protocol, as well as some convenience functions for
  [nbdnl][godoc-nbdnl]. The network protocol is used as a handshake between
  client and server, to negotiate optional features and other options. Under
  Linux, there are also a couple of functions provided to easily hook up a
  `Device` implementation and use it as a block device.
* [nbdnl][godoc-nbdnl], containing an implementation of the NBD generic netlink
  family, based on Matt Layher's [genetlink package][godoc-genetlink]. This
  package can only be used on Linux; you should guard any usage with
  corresponding build tags.

The main usecase of this library is fuzzing code that tries to provide durable
filesystem-operations. It allows you to implement aribtrary failure modes of a
block device and then create any filesystem you'd like to test on it. For
example, to fuzz for crash-resistence, you can have the block device return
errors on any write-operations after an arbitrary point in time and then
repeatedly mount a filesystem, run a bunch of application code, simulate a
crash and then check invariants (after re-mounting). This can provide some
confidence (though no guarantees) that your code works with actual
filesystem-implementations.

Note, that any code that wants to configure the in-kernel NBD client has to be
privileged (the process needs to have `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`).

# NBD tool

This repo contains basic CLI tool to configure/serve/connect to NBD devices. You can install it via

```
go get -u github.com/Merovius/nbd/cmd/nbd
```

To see what it can do, use `nbd help`. Note, that most of the useful commands
require root (or, more specifically, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) to work.

One of the most useful subcommands is `lo`, which can be used to use a file as
a block device (similarly to `losetup`). It *also* supports toggling write-only
mode of the device via a unix signal, though, which can be used to test the
durability of software not written in Go. Refer to `nbd help lo` for details.
